# Neon_Knight's Ladder Readme

## Overview

A Single-Player ladder built as coding practice, fully functioning, though a bit long.

It requires the base game and the four Bonus Packs, as it not only uses all of the new maps but also the newer character models.

Descriptions from the maps are taken from the regular, GOTY and console ladders as well as pre-release material and those fanfiction descriptions once dropped onto the old Liandri Archives by Deathstalker. These latter ones were too good to be left out, so they're conserved here instead.

Descriptions for the bots and teams are taken from the regular, GOTY and console ladders as well as pre-release material and manuals.

## Installation

* Drop the entirety of the .zip content into the _\System_ folder of UT, with the exception of this file, which should go instead in _\Help_.
* In-game, go to the _Mod_ menu and _"Neon_Knight's Ladder"_. Create a new game.
